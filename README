Simple Note Taker App

By: Alex Ackerman

This is a very simple note taking app.  I utilized an online service
called Parse as a cloud-hosted backend.  Parse provides a JavaScript
SDK that makes some of the backend interaction much easier.  I also
used Twitter Bootstrap elements just to make it look a little bit nicer.
Given more time I would have put greater effort into using Bootstrap to
make the app more responsive to varying screen sizes.

A note can be saved on one device, and when a user navigates back to the
app, the previously saved note is displayed and can be edited.

Shortcomings/hacks/deficiences/etc.:
-no user/account considerations
-security is obviously non-existent
-I placed a "starter" object in the database so that I did not have to
handle the case in which it was empty.
-only ability to handle one note
-concurrency issues could occur if multiple people opened the app and
tried to edit at the same time...but that is related to having no users
-I have had the app crash a couple of times but I did not put much
effort into solving it as I think it had something to with Parse not
receiving the HTTP request...If this happens simply refresh page
